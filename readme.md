# Modal

A simple modal plugin written in vanilla JavaScript and no external dependencies.


I wrote this little plugin as more of an experiment for myself. I wanted something super simple without the need for jQuery or any other JavaScript framework.
It was written to be used on my [blog](http://matthewroach.me) as an image modal viewer for gallery style post outputs.
